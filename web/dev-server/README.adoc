= Dev server

Dev server for serving both gondul api and frontend ("map") on the same (local) host.

Set up your ENV as exemplified in `.env-example`.

Run the api/backend as described in ../../api and then run the dev server on a separate port, e.g.:

```
uv run fastapi run main.py --port 8088
```

Then visit http://localhost:8088[http://localhost:8088] in your browser.
